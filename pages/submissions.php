            Journal of Physics : Conference Series (JPCS) currently indexed in the SCOPUS databased as "Conference
            Proceedings".
          <ul class="unlist">
            <li>Author(s)who has paid their registration fees is invited to submit ONE full paper on his/her contributed

            <li>Please use only institutional/professional email addresses when preparing the paper.</li>
            <li>Peer review on these papers will be conducted by expert referees (for both physics contents and IOP's
              format).</li>
            <li>To comply with IOP's standard, all research works must have enough Physics (in terms of both quality to
              generate qualified new knowledge in Physics and Physics content to be greater than 50%). Plagiarism and
